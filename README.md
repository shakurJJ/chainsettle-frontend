# ChainSettle — Frontend Repo

> **Next.js 14 frontend for milestone-based supply chain escrow on Stellar**

This is **Repo 3 of 3** in the ChainSettle project:

| Repo | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `chainsetttle-contract` | Soroban smart contract (Rust) |
| `chainsetttle-backend` | NestJS REST API + event poller |
| `chainsettle-frontend` ← you are here | Next.js 14 + Freighter wallet UI |

## What This Frontend Does

ChainSettle frontend is the user-facing interface for creating, tracking, and resolving milestone-based shipments through a Stellar escrow contract. It is designed to be simple and secure for all roles in the supply chain.

Key user experiences:

- **Sign-In With Stellar** — authenticate with Freighter, no passwords required.
- **Create shipments** — configure buyer/supplier/logistics/arbiter, define milestone splits, then sign once to lock USDC into Soroban escrow.
- **Track active shipments** — view shipment status, progress, and related chain events.
- **Verify on-chain data** — Stellar addresses and transaction hashes are linked directly to Stellar Expert.
- **Role-driven milestone actions** — suppliers submit proof, buyers confirm delivery, logistics update transit status, and arbiters resolve disputes.
- **Search and filter** — browse shipments by status and by shipment ID or counterparty address.

Every transaction is signed through the user's Freighter wallet. The frontend never stores private keys.

## Latest Features

This repo now includes a complete set of UI improvements for the shipment list and shipment creation workflow.

### On-chain verification links

- Added `src/components/StellarLink.tsx`.
- Renders Stellar addresses and transaction hashes as anchor links.
- Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK` to generate the correct Stellar Expert base URL:
  - `testnet` → `https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/`
  - `mainnet` → `https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/`
- Address links point to `/account/{address}`.
- Transaction hash links point to `/tx/{hash}`.
- Links open in a new tab using `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

### Shipment metadata UX

- Updated `src/components/shipments/ShipmentMeta.tsx` to replace raw address/hash text with `StellarLink`.
- Preserves copy-to-clipboard behavior while making chain references instantly clickable.

### Shipment list filtering

- Updated `src/app/dashboard/shipments/page.tsx`.
- Added top tabs for: `All`, `Active`, `Completed`, and `Cancelled`.
- Displays counts for each status in tab labels.
- Highlights the active status tab visually.
- Persists filter state in the URL with `?status=`.
- Maintains compatibility with the search box.
- Fetches status counts from the backend using the existing shipments list API.

### Milestone validation for creation

- Updated `src/app/dashboard/shipments/create/page.tsx`.
- Added a live percentage indicator beneath the milestone section.
- Shows a green success state when milestone percentages sum to `100%`.
- Shows a red warning state when the sum is invalid.
- Disables the submit button unless the milestone split totals exactly `100%`.
- Enforces numeric input between `1` and `100` for each milestone percentage.
- Supports dynamic milestone row add/remove with real-time total recalculation.

These updates improve reliability and reduce contract submission failures by catching invalid milestone splits in the UI.

## Key Flows

### Authentication (Sign-In With Stellar)

1. User clicks connect.
2. Freighter returns the public Stellar address.
3. Frontend requests a nonce from `/auth/nonce`.
4. User signs the nonce in Freighter.
5. Frontend sends the signed payload to `/auth/login`.
6. Backend returns a JWT and user profile.
7. Frontend stores auth state and redirects to the dashboard.

### Shipment creation

1. User enters buyer/supplier/logistics/arbiter addresses.
2. User defines milestones and payment percentages.
3. The UI validates that the milestone total equals `100%`.
4. The user signs a Soroban transaction through Freighter.
5. The transaction is published to Stellar.
6. After confirmation, the shipment is stored in the backend.

### Shipment filtering and verification

- Shipment list supports text search and status tabs.
- Status selection persists in the browser URL.
- Shipment metadata includes Stellar Expert links for both accounts and tx hashes.
- Users can verify chain state without manual lookup.
