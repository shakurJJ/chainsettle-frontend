# ChainSettle — Frontend Repo

> **Next.js 14 frontend for milestone-based supply chain escrow on Stellar**

This is **Repo 3 of 3** in the ChainSettle project:

| Repo | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `chainsetttle-contract` | Soroban smart contract (Rust) |
| `chainsetttle-backend` | NestJS REST API + event poller |
| `chainsettle-frontend` ← you are here | Next.js 14 + Freighter wallet UI |

## What This Frontend Does

ChainSettle frontend is the user-facing interface for creating, tracking, and resolving milestone-based shipments through a Stellar escrow contract. It is designed to be simple and secure for all roles in the supply chain.

Key user experiences:

- **Sign-In With Stellar** — authenticate with Freighter, no passwords required.
- **Create shipments** — configure buyer/supplier/logistics/arbiter, define milestone splits, then sign once to lock USDC into Soroban escrow.
- **Track active shipments** — view shipment status, progress, and related chain events.
- **Verify on-chain data** — Stellar addresses and transaction hashes are linked directly to Stellar Expert.
- **Role-driven milestone actions** — suppliers submit proof, buyers confirm delivery, logistics update transit status, and arbiters resolve disputes.
- **Search and filter** — browse shipments by status and by shipment ID or counterparty address.

Every transaction is signed through the user's Freighter wallet. The frontend never stores private keys.

## Latest Features

This repo now includes a complete set of UI improvements for the shipment list and shipment creation workflow.

### On-chain verification links

- Added `src/components/StellarLink.tsx`.
- Renders Stellar addresses and transaction hashes as anchor links.
- Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK` to generate the correct Stellar Expert base URL:
  - `testnet` → `https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/`
  - `mainnet` → `https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/`
- Address links point to `/account/{address}`.
- Transaction hash links point to `/tx/{hash}`.
- Links open in a new tab using `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

### Shipment metadata UX

- Updated `src/components/shipments/ShipmentMeta.tsx` to replace raw address/hash text with `StellarLink`.
- Preserves copy-to-clipboard behavior while making chain references instantly clickable.

### Shipment list filtering

- Updated `src/app/dashboard/shipments/page.tsx`.
- Added top tabs for: `All`, `Active`, `Completed`, and `Cancelled`.
- Displays counts for each status in tab labels.
- Highlights the active status tab visually.
- Persists filter state in the URL with `?status=`.
- Maintains compatibility with the search box.
- Fetches status counts from the backend using the existing shipments list API.

### Milestone validation for creation

- Updated `src/app/dashboard/shipments/create/page.tsx`.
- Added a live percentage indicator beneath the milestone section.
- Shows a green success state when milestone percentages sum to `100%`.
- Shows a red warning state when the sum is invalid.
- Disables the submit button unless the milestone split totals exactly `100%`.
- Enforces numeric input between `1` and `100` for each milestone percentage.
- Supports dynamic milestone row add/remove with real-time total recalculation.

These updates improve reliability and reduce contract submission failures by catching invalid milestone splits in the UI.

### Shipment discussion & notes thread (#65)

- Added a comments and discussion thread on the shipment detail page (`/dashboard/shipments/[id]`).
- Rendered via `src/components/shipments/ShipmentComments.tsx` under the milestone timeline.
- Counterparties (`buyer`, `supplier`, `logistics`) and the `arbiter` can post and view notes to coordinate delivery and resolve disputes with complete context.
- Observers and non-participants see a read-only view with comment posting restricted.
- Each comment displays:
  - Author address linked to Stellar Expert explorer via `StellarLink`.
  - Author role badge (`Buyer`, `Supplier`, `Logistics`, `Arbiter`, or `Read-only`) styled according to the design system.
  - Relative timestamp (`timeAgo`).
- Text content is rendered safely (`whitespace-pre-wrap break-words`) to support natural multiline formatting without HTML or XSS injection risks.
- Enforces a 1,000 character maximum limit with a live character counter and keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter` to submit).
- Full empty state and loading skeleton states included.
- Automatic 15-second background polling synchronized with shipment status refreshes, manual sync, and interval timers.
- Typed REST client wrappers added in `src/lib/api/services.ts` (`commentsApi.list(shipmentId)`, `commentsApi.create(shipmentId, body)`) and data types in `src/types/index.ts` (`Comment`, `CreateCommentInput`).

#### Expected Backend API Contract

The frontend expects the following REST endpoints on the backend service (`chainsetttle-backend`):

##### 1. List Comments
- **Method & Route**: `GET /shipments/:id/comments`
- **Auth**: Optional / Bearer JWT
- **Response**: `200 OK`
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "comment_abc123",
      "shipmentId": "SHIP-20260927-ABCD",
      "authorAddress": "GAA...",
      "authorRole": "BUYER",
      "content": "Customs clearance paperwork has been uploaded for Milestone 2.",
      "createdAt": "2026-09-27T14:30:00.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2026-09-27T14:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

##### 2. Create Comment
- **Method & Route**: `POST /shipments/:id/comments`
- **Auth**: Required (`Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`)
- **Headers**: `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Request Body**:
```json
{
  "content": "Customs clearance paperwork has been uploaded for Milestone 2."
}
```
- **Validation**:
  - `content`: string, non-empty, max 1000 characters.
  - User extracted from JWT must be a party to the shipment (`buyerAddress`, `supplierAddress`, `logisticsAddress`, `arbiterAddress`). Non-parties receive `403 Forbidden`.
- **Response**: `201 Created`
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "comment_abc124",
    "shipmentId": "SHIP-20260927-ABCD",
    "authorAddress": "GAA...",
    "authorRole": "BUYER",
    "content": "Customs clearance paperwork has been uploaded for Milestone 2.",
    "createdAt": "2026-09-27T14:30:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

## Internationalization

The frontend uses `next-intl` with English as the default locale. Translation messages live in `src/i18n/messages/en.json`, and supported locales are declared in `src/i18n/config.ts`.

To add a locale:

1. Copy `src/i18n/messages/en.json` to a new file such as `src/i18n/messages/fr.json` and translate its values.
2. Add the locale code to the `locales` array in `src/i18n/config.ts`.
3. Load the new message bundle in `src/app/providers.tsx` and pass the selected locale and messages to `NextIntlClientProvider`.
4. Keep translation keys stable across locale files so components can use the same `useTranslations` calls.

## Key Flows

### Authentication (Sign-In With Stellar)

1. User clicks connect.
2. Freighter returns the public Stellar address.
3. Frontend requests a nonce from `/auth/nonce`.
4. User signs the nonce in Freighter.
5. Frontend sends the signed payload to `/auth/login`.
6. Backend returns a JWT and user profile.
7. Frontend stores auth state and redirects to the dashboard.

### Shipment creation

1. User enters buyer/supplier/logistics/arbiter addresses.
2. User defines milestones and payment percentages.
3. The UI validates that the milestone total equals `100%`.
4. The user signs a Soroban transaction through Freighter.
5. The transaction is published to Stellar.
6. After confirmation, the shipment is stored in the backend.

### Shipment filtering and verification

- Shipment list supports text search and status tabs.
- Status selection persists in the browser URL.
- Shipment metadata includes Stellar Expert links for both accounts and tx hashes.
- Users can verify chain state without manual lookup.
